# Solana GIF board.

This project implements the backend for a GIF board as a **Solana smart contract**.

The contract holds a list of GIFs along with the name of the person who submitted them.

The [frontend(https://github.com/scheuclu/gif-portal-starter) then calls this contract as a database.

The public address of this contract is [GZnUtzwNfMrsK7U9NZT1PwrgnUnu6z9cGwc1v1Q7e5ta](https://explorer.solana.com/address/GZnUtzwNfMrsK7U9NZT1PwrgnUnu6z9cGwc1v1Q7e5ta?cluster=devnet).

The contract is only deployed to the devnet.
